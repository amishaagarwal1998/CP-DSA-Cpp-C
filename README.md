# Data-structures-and-algorithms
All the basic and advanced data structures and algorithms implemented either in C or C++. This is the part of my data structures and analysis of algorithms laboratory work in which I wrote the following codes by myself. Any contributions and PRs' having some new algorithms and using some different data structures are most welcome to enhance the diversity of the current repository.
List of algorithms/topics included:

	1-Bellman Ford(Graph)
	2-Kruskal(Graph)
	3-Union Find(Graph)
	4-Prim's(Graph)
	5-Divide and Conquer	
	6-Knapsack(Dynamic Programming)
	7-Hashing
	8-Sorting
	9-Greedy
	10-Travelling Salesman
	11-Bit Manipulation
	12-Binary Search
	13-Prefix Sum
	14-Tree Traversal
	15-Linked List
	16-Arrays
	17-Linked List
	18-Stack
	19-Queue
	20-Backtracking
	
    The repo also contains PDF files of CTCI and Google Intern Preparation!
